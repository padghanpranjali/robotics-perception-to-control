## Robotics Perception to Control Pipeline

Goal: Build a perception-to-control prototype for robotic manipulation using RGB-D sensing and feedback control.

This project incrementally builds:
- RGB-D perception
- 3D geometry reasoning
- Object state estimation
- Closed-loop control in simulation
### Day 1 — RGB-D Data Exploration
- Loaded and visualized RGB and depth images
- Verified alignment between color and depth
- Inspected depth value ranges and data types
- Established sensor-level understanding of RGB-D inputs
